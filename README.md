### DuckToken.sol
<p> Create a DUK token as per ERC 20 standard on ETH test-net (e.g. Rinkeby) </p>

* Enter your meta-mask account on test-net into the constructor of the main contract *(Note: This step is important)*
* Deploy the contract and copy the contract location (you can find this on your test-net etherscan.io, for rinkeyby: https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/)
* Go to your meta-mask and client IMPORT TOKEN, add the location of the contract on testnet, click next
* Meta-mask should pick up the token code and add the balance to your account
